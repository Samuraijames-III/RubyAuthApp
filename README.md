# README

This a project I wrote in Ruby, and Ruby on Rails to learn how to handle user authorization and basic database management, creation, access, updating user table data. 

## Getting started

First, open terminal on the project folder and install dependencies.

```
gem install 
```

Then start the rails server;

This should auto open the application in a default browser at: http://127.0.0.1:3000

```
rails server
```
## Application screen grabs

You will need your own postgres SQL DB to support the user actions.

The home page has placeholder copy for UI demonstration purposes.
